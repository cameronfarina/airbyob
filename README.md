**Listings Page** -- The listings page features a map with the price of the listing you're currently rendering. The listing rows will provide key details of the listing, like reviews, the type of listing, the amenities, number of beds and bathrooms as well as whether or not the listing is furnished. Some of our listings are up for sublets, in which case, you may have to BYOB.

**Responsiveness** -- Shrinking the listing page will remove the map and center the filter buttons, shrinking the screen even more will result in the removal of the filter buttons as well.
